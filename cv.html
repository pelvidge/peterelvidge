      <b>GUI Team Leader 1998 - 2001</b>
      <br><br>I worked with this international technology company in Slough for three years.  I headed up a GUI team responsible for development of the front end of a large syndicated lending system. The base system, 
      which was developed in Linc for banks in London, Zurich and New York, had over 300 screens, and was designed to run on Unix with dumb terminals. 
      My GUI team provided an optional Windows style user interface using Powerbuilder 6.5. PVCS was used for source management. 
      On completion of the syndicated lending project, I joined Unisysâ€™ International Banking Services section on a part time basis, 
      again doing Powerbuilder front end work on their core banking products.<br>

      <b>Consultant analyst/programmer 1996 - 1998</b>
      <br><br>In 1996 I joined an EDS team bidding to win a contract to develop 'TAFMIS', a large training development and administration system for the Army Training and Recruitment Agency. The prototype system I helped develop using S-Designor and RAD techniques eventually won the bid for EDS and I was invited to stay with the project team to help develop the 'real' system. I spent my first few months post award in data analysis, and authored the first cut of the logical data model. Later I co-authored the functional specification for the first tranche of the system. The detail design was achieved through an iterative prototyping approach in collaboration with user representatives. Following design, I worked on construction, testing and implementation and had the satisfaction of seeing a large project all the way through from requirements capture to live running. My final task was the construction of a distribution mechanism based on SQL Server Replication for the transport of trainee details around the various Army training schools that used TAFMIS<br>

      <br><br>Beckman had an ageing Sales Order Entry system written in Cobol, with TurboImage databases, KSAM files, and Vplus screens. Their chosen migration path to a client server architecture involved a first step of changing the user interface only. I was recruited to replace the old Vplus screens with a Windows style Order Entry facility, but to still capture the data to the original Image databases. I used Powerbuilder 3.0a to develop the screens and used Reflection PPL (Process to Process Link) to interface Powerbuilder to TurboImage and KSAM. I was the sole designer / developer on this project, and saw the system through construction, testing and implementation. I also produced technical documentation and stayed on for user support. This project gave me 12 months intensive experience of Powerbuilder design and development<br>
